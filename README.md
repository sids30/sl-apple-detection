# Apple Detection Streamlit App üçé

Deployed Streamlit App Link: https://apple-detect.streamlit.app/

This interactive web application detects **red and green apples** in uploaded images using **OpenCV and color segmentation**.  
It draws **bounding boxes** around the apples and displays the **total number of apples detected**.

---

## üß† Model Description

- The app uses a **color-based detection model**:
  - Converts images to **HSV color space**.
  - Creates masks for **red and green apples** using wide HSV ranges to handle different lighting conditions.
  - Applies **Gaussian blur** and **morphological operations** to remove noise.
  - Detects contours and filters by **area** and **circularity** to identify roughly circular objects.
  - Draws **bounding boxes** around detected apples.
- This approach is fast and works for images with multiple apples.
